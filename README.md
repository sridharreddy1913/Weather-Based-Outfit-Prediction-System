# Weather-Based-Outfit-Prediction-System

The WBOPS for short is an application that provides recommendations of what clothing
should be worn according to the sourceâ€™s machine learning algorithm driven analysis of the
weather. Out of these, this model creates an optimized outfit that corresponds with the
expected weather conditions hence providing users with a useful tool for choosing the right
clothes to wear next. Through the use of the Random Forest Classifier, the model provides
high accurate outfit type predictions for several types of outfits. In this research, details of the
project mode of operation, the result obtained as well as the lessons learned from the
models have been provided herein.
